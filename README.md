<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Create Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines
- Connect the virtual machines
- Install and Setup Active Directory
- Join Client to Domain Controller
- Setup Remote Desktop for Non-Admins

<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

<h3>Creating Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines</h3>

In Microsoft Azure, provided you have an active subscription, search "Virtual Machines" and click on the corresponding link. Once there, we need to create our Domain Controller (DC-1). Create a new resource group and take note of the name. We can just use DC-1 for the name of our Domain Controller. As for the region, take note of which region and zone you choose. For security type, I personally have has issues doing this when set to anything other than "Standard" so I recommend that's where we set it. For the image, we'll be using Windows Server 2022.

<p>
Under the Networking section, we also want to take note of the name of the Virtual Network being created. Click Review + Create. After a small validation period, check to make sure everything is set up correctly and confirm the creation of DC-1.

Next, preferably after the first Virtual Machine has finished deploying to avoid complications, we create a second VM. This VM will be known as Client-1. Make sure to put Client-1 in the same resource group, region, and availability zone. Set security type to standard, and for Client-1 we will be using the Windows 10 (22H2) image. Be sure to check the authorization box at the bottom before you proceed to the networking tab.

In the Networking section, be sure to put Client-1 on the same Virtual Network as DC-1. Next, Review + Create, just like before.
